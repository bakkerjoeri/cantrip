## 2.1.0
- There are two new final bosses:
    - The Crimson Mage relies on card draw to damage you.
    - The Void Priest communes with the all-devouring unknowable.
- Enigma was removed from the game.
- Added three new cards:
    - Lichen curse (costs 1, rare): For 3 turns, when you do damage, gain that much AP.
    - Wellspring (costs 1, rare): Until the end of your next turn, when you draw a card, gain 1 AP. Draw a card.
    - Healing rain (cost 1, uncommon): For 3 turns, draw 1 more card at the start of your turn.
- You now start each run with 3 draft rounds to make the first battles more interesting.
- After you beat the game, you unlock custom runs. In this mode you can start a run with modifications that affect the way the game works.
- Each room now has a little introductory story vignette.
- An event log now shows what is happening during a battle.
- Some enemy decks were changed a bit to make them more fun to play against.
- There is now a dedicated settings screen where you can toggle fullscreen, screen shake and screen flashes, and the option to unlock custom runs immediately.
- Playing and drafting is sped up considerably by reducing animations and removing delays.
- The sorting of the deck overview on draft screen no longer jumps around with each pick.
- You no longer see enemies more than once in a run.
- Fixed a bug where "Riposte" into "Rest" would end the wrong player's turn.
- Fixed a bug where "Riposte" into "Rest" could escape a loss or victory state.
- Fixed a bug where drawing cards after reshuffling sometimes lead to an invisible card in your hand.
- Fixed a bug where total wins stat was lost
- Fixed a bug where AP gain from "Meditate" was not affected by "Poison the well"
- Fixed a bug where "Read mind" could copy more cards than fit in your hand.

## 2.0.3
- Fixed a bug that caused a crash on victory when a pre-v2.0.3 save file was present.
